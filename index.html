                <p>The best Batman series in the gaming industry that is respected many DC fans and non fans. <br><br>
                The series lasted in 2009 to 2015 until 2024 with Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League as
                a follow-up from Arkham Knight but unfortunately is not appreciated by fans as it didn't get
                the expectations from people who enjoyed the Arkham Games.</p>
